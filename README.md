## mission

When we at Bootcampr graduated from Dev Bootcamp Seattle, we didn't want to lose the special community we had made through weeks of learning, hard work, and (of course) stress. In fact, we wanted to extend that community even further, and invite in all who have shared in those experiences.

 We want to learn more. We want to share what we know. We want to know you better.

We want to make beautiful and meaningful things, and we want to do it with you.

[Let's get started today.](http://bootcampr.herokuapp.com/)

## usage

### you

**sign up**  
You can register an account with Bootcampr through your email, or through authorizing your github account to connect with us.

Once you've signed up, you can begin contributing to our community of bootcamp students and graduates. You'll be first taken to finish filling out your profile, where you can let the community know some things about you, including what you're interested in.

**make things**  
Then you can begin making projects and scheduling events for the community. Whether you want to set up a physical meet-up to network or talk shop, or online 'office hours' to work through new technologies, or organize a project, Bootcampr events can help you get the word out. Projects serve as great pitch points for that idea you had, and can help you find others who are interested in putting heads together to solve big problems (and little ones too!).

### your community

**join in**  
Browse our listings of categories, events, and projects. Find an event you can't wait to attend? Mark it down! See a project you want to make? Become a collaborator! We want to make it easy for you to find things to do, so we've provided these tools for you to start participating in the community.

**connect**  
When you're attending events and collaborating on projects, you'll meet and work with a lot of different people. Keep building your connections through your profile--you can add handles to help others find you--and through others, where you can find helpful links to Twitter, LinkedIn, and more to build your network from Bootcampr.

### your world

**follow us**  
Want to know what's new? The Bootcampr Twitter ([@bootcamprapp](https://twitter.com/bootcamprapp)) provides real-time updates as new events and projects are added to the site. Follow it to see the latest happenings in the community.

**get started**
